abstract: "We explore the problem of sharing data that pertains to individuals with anonymity guarantees, where each user requires a desired level of privacy. We propose the Ô¨Årst sharedmemory as well as distributed memory parallel algorithms for the adaptive anonymity problem that achieves this goal, and produces high quality anonymized datasets."
