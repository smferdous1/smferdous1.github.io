abstract: "Autism is a disorder of neural development which affects about one in every 150 kids on average. One of the major complexities regarding autistic children in social communication is the speech disorder. The problems related to speech disorder fall into different categories and unintelligibility in speech is one of them. Although there is no definite medicine or treatment for autism, doctors, therapists, and special teachers can help kids with autism overcome many difficulties by different physical and psychological therapies. In this paper we have demonstrated our newly developed interactive computer game which will be helpful in increasing intelligibility in the speeches of autistic children and can be used as a therapy besides the traditional approaches. During our five months of intervention with the autistic children of Autism Welfare Foundation (AWF) at Dhaka, we checked the effectiveness of this therapy and got some encouraging results."
