abstract: "In this paper, we consider the problem of finding minimum common partition of two strings (MCSP). The problem has its application in genome comparison. As it is an NP-hard, discrete combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a metaheuristic technique, namely, MAX-MIN ant system to solve this. The preliminary experimental results are found to be promising."
