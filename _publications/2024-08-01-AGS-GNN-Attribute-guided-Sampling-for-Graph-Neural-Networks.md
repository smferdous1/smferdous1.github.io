abstract: "We propose AGS-GNN, a novel attribute-guided sampling algorithm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). AGS-GNN exploits the node features and the connectivity structure of a graph while simultaneously adapting for both homophily and heterophily in graphs. In homophilic graphs, vertices of the same class are more likely to be adjacent, but vertices of different classes tend to be adjacent in heterophilic graphs. GNNs have been successfully applied to homophilic graphs, but their utility to heterophilic graphs remains challenging. The state-of-the-art GNNs for heterophilic graphs use the full neighborhood of a node instead of sampling it, and hence do not scale to large graphs and are not inductive. We develop dual-channel sampling techniques based on feature-similarity and feature-diversity to select subsets of neighbors for a node that capture adaptive information from homophilic and heterophilic neighborhoods. Currently, AGS-GNN is the only algorithm that explicitly controls homophily in the sampled subgraph through similar and diverse neighborhood samples. For diverse neighborhood sampling, we employ submodularity, a novel contribution in this context. We pre-compute the sampling distribution in parallel, achieving the desired scalability. Using an extensive dataset consisting of 35 small ({\textless} 100ùêæ nodes) and large (‚â• 100ùêæ nodes) homophilic and heterophilic graphs, we demonstrate the superiority of AGS-GNN compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. AGS-GNN achieves test accuracy comparable to the best-performing heterophilic GNNs, even outperforming methods that use the entire graph for node classification. AGS-GNN converges faster than methods that sample neighborhoods randomly, and can be incorporated into existing GNN models that employ node or graph sampling."
