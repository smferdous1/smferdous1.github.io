I am a data scientist and ex-[Linus Pauling Postocdoral Fellow](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/linus-pauling-distinguished-postdoctoral-fellowship/recipients) at [Pacific Northwest Natonal Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/), working at the intersection of **algorithm design** and **high-performance computing**. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the department of computer science at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), from where I received my PhD in computer science.

My research is in solving large-scale combinatorial problems, where my goal is to design algorithms that are **theoretically sound** and **practically efficient**. To achieve this I often utilize **streaming, parallel and distributed memory** computational models. I am highly interested to explore interdisciplinary applications of combinatorial problems,  particularly in **quantum computing, data science, and machine learning**.
