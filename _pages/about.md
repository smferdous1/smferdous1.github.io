Hello! Welcome to my virtual abode. I am Ferdous, a PhD candidate in [Computer Science](https://cs.purdue.edu) at Purdue University, USA, advised by [Prof. Alex Pothen](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apothen/). Before starting PhD at Purdue, I completed my Bachelor and Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). I also served as a faculty member at [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)](https://www.aust.edu/cse). I spent three summers as a PhD intern at Pacific Northwest National Lab and Nokia Bell Labs, NJ.

My research interest includes Combinatorial Optimization, Combinatorial Scientific Computing, High-Performance Computing, and Applied algorithms.
