	abstract = {Autism is a disorder of neural development which affects about one in every 150 kids on average. One of the major complexities regarding autistic children in social communication is the speech disorder. The problems related to speech disorder fall into different categories and unintelligibility in speech is one of them. Although there is no definite medicine or treatment for autism, doctors, therapists, and special teachers can help kids with autism overcome many difficulties by different physical and psychological therapies. In this paper we have demonstrated our newly developed interactive computer game which will be helpful in increasing intelligibility in the speeches of autistic children and can be used as a therapy besides the traditional approaches. During our five months of intervention with the autistic children of Autism Welfare Foundation (AWF) at Dhaka, we checked the effectiveness of this therapy and got some encouraging results.},

The Dual Cover algorithm can also be implemented to be faster than the other 3/2-approximation algorithms on serial computers. Many of these algorithms can be extended to solve the b-Edge Cover problem as well.

	abstract = {Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life. This is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of human brain. Children diagnosed with autism often are self-absorbed and seem to exist in a private world where they are unable to successfully communicate and interact with others. Sometimes they have difficulties in developing speaking skills and understanding what others say to them. Lack of fluency in the speech is one of the most frequently found problems with autistic children. The traditional methods for increasing fluency were found to be monotonous and hence, not much successful during our three months of observations over the participants of Autism Welfare Foundation (AWF) at Dhaka. Therefore, we developed an interactive computer game for the autistic children for improving the fluency in their speech. Our game produced encouraging results over a participant during three months of observation. In this paper, we describe our project and the outcomes.},

	abstract = {We describe a paradigm for designing parallel algorithms via approximation, and illustrate it on the b-Edge Cover problem. A b-Edge Cover of minimum weight in a graph is a subset C of its edges such that at least a specified number b(v) of edges in C is incident on each vertex v, and the sum of the edge weights in C is minimum. The Greedy algorithm and a variant, the LSE algorithm, provide 3/2-approximation guarantees in the worst-case for this problem, but these algorithms have limited parallelism. Hence we design two new 2-approximation algorithms with greater concurrency. The MCE algorithm reduces the computation of a b-Edge Cover to that of finding a b'-Matching, by exploiting the relationship between these subgraphs in an approximation context. The LSENW is derived from the LSE algorithm using static edge weights rather than dynamically computing effective edge weights. This relaxation gives S-LSE a worse approximation guarantee but makes it more amenable to parallelization. We prove that both the MCE and S-LSE algorithms compute the same b-EDGE COVER with at most twice the weight of the minimum weight edge cover. In practice, the 2-approximation and 3/2-approximation algorithms compute edge covers of weight within 10\% the optimal. We implement three of the approximation algorithms, MCE, LSE, and S-LSE, on shared memory multi-core machines, including an Intel Xeon and an IBM Power8 machine with 8 TB memory. The MCE algorithm is the fastest of these by an order of magnitude or more. It computes an edge cover in a graph with billions of edges in 20 seconds using two hundred threads on the IBM Power8. We also show that the parallel depth and work can be bounded for the Suitor and b-Suitor algorithms when edge weights are random.},

  abstract={In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving decentralized aggregation protocol for federated learning. We formulate the distributed aggregation protocol with the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) algorithm and examine its privacy challenges. Unlike prior works that use differential privacy or homomorphic encryption for privacy, we develop a protocol that controls communication among participants in each round of aggregation to minimize privacy leakage. We establish the protocol's privacy guarantee against an honest-but-curious adversary. We also propose an efficient algorithm to construct such a communication pattern, which is inspired by combinatorial block design theory. Our secure aggregation protocol based on the novel group-based communication pattern leads to an efficient algorithm for federated training with privacy guarantees. We evaluate our federated training algorithm on computer vision and natural language processing models over benchmark datasets with 9 and 15 distributed sites. Experimental results demonstrate the privacy-preserving capabilities of our algorithm while maintaining learning performance comparable to the baseline centralized federated learning.},

This problem is NP-hard; the new algorithms have approximation ratio 1/3, and are relaxations of the Greedy algorithm that rely only on local information in the graph, making them parallelizable. We have designed and implemented Local Lazy Greedy algorithms for both serial and parallel computers. We have applied the approximate submodular b-matching algorithm to assign tasks to processors in the computation of Fock matrices in quantum chemistry on parallel computers. The assignment seeks to reduce the run time by balancing the computational load on the processors and bounding the number of messages that each processor sends. We show that the new assignment of tasks to processors provides a four fold speedup over the currently used assignment in the NWChemEx software on 8000 processors on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab.},

	abstract = {Given two graphs, the objective of network alignment is to find a one-to-one mapping of vertices in one graph (ùê¥) to vertices in the other (ùêµ), such that the number of overlaps is maximized. We say that edges (ùëñ, ùëó) ‚àà ùê¥ and (ùëñ‚Ä≤, ùëó‚Ä≤) ‚àà ùêµ are overlapped if ùëñ is mapped to ùëñ‚Ä≤ and ùëó is mapped to ùëó‚Ä≤. Network alignment is an important optimization problem with several applications in bioinformatics, computer vision and ontology matching. Since it is an NP-hard problem, efficient heuristics and scalable implementations are necessary. However, a combination of combinatorial and algebraic kernels within the network alignment algorithm poses significant hurdles for parallelization. Further, load imbalance and irregular DRAM traffic limit achievable performance on GPUs. In this work, we introduce a novel framework (cuAlign) that combines intra-network proximity using node (vertex) embedding, sparsification for computational efficiency, and belief propagation (BP) and approximate weighted matching for alignment. We demonstrate qualitative improvements up to 22\% over state-of-the-art approaches. We provide a scalable implementation targeting modern GPU accelerators. Our novel approach identifies and exploits unique structural properties of the BP-based algorithm and employs code fusion to reduce data movement between different steps of the algorithm. Using a diverse set of inputs, we demonstrate up to 19√ó speedup for belief propagation, 3√ó speedup for approximate weighted matching, and 15√ó total, relative to a state-of-the-art multi-threaded implementation.},

We present Picasso, a randomized memory-efficient iterative parallel graph coloring algorithm with theoretical sublinear space guarantees under practical assumptions. The parameters of our algorithm provide a trade-off between coloring quality and resource consumption. To assist the user, we also propose a machine learning model to predict the coloring algorithm‚Äôs parameters considering these trade-offs.
